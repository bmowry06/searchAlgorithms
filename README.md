# searchAlgorithms
Implements astar and breadth first search algorithms for basic mazes. The maze and type of search to perform are specified as command line arguments. "S" represents the start point, "G" the end point, "." the route suggested by the algorithm, and "%" barriers that cannot be traversed. Example run command after compiling: "Findpath testfile/input1.txt bfs" use "astar" instead of "bfs" to run the astar search algorithm.
